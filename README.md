# Iris-Classification
#### We utilize Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify Iris flowers into their respective species based on measurements of their sepals and petals. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that works by finding the best possible boundary to separate different classes in a high-dimensional space. By leveraging SVM, we aim to accurately categorize Iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica species. Through this project, we not only demonstrate the practical application of SVM in classification tasks but also gain insights into its effectiveness with real-world datasets. Ultimately, our goal is to showcase the utility of SVM in Iris flower classification and its broader implications for machine learning applications.
